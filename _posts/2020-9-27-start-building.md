Most of the times, People gets started in the world of programming with one
tutorial or the other. Tutorials are great because it helps beginners grab new
concepts with some level of speed, and they'll most likely build projects in the
the process with the help of the tutor leading then at every steps of the projects.

>But there is loop involved, that loop of watching the next video, pausing/playing
to type out the code, and the likes. sooner or later the newbies/beginners gets
stuck in that loop and that is when it becomes **_tutorial paralysis_**.

## Are tutorials bad?

Tutorials aren't bad, in fact they are great for newbies. But its becomes *bad* when
when you are stuck in that loop.

Every challenge you'll face in tutorials are already solved, and even if you have
to solve it first before checking the solution, you'll most likely check the solution
couple of times before arriving at yours. This is bad, because in the real world, 
your job as a programmer is to develop solution not write others solution.

## Why then should you drop tutorials

Well, because getting stuck in that loop was never your intention when you started
programming and it is very bad for your growth as a developer.

What makes you grow as a developer is by spending much of your time implementing
the concepts you've learnt in tutorials for real world projects.

## What to do instead

Start building!!. Like any other field, its takes time and practice to become the
best in their field. The same goes for  software development, web developement, and
the likes. Building real world projects ranging from mini-minor-major in  my opinion
is key to securing your stardom in the field of programming.

## Summary

I've been there, and I clearly get the feeling of getting stuck in the loop and
I understand how overwhelming it is to start a project for the first time without
some solutions already in place.. But trust me, with time and constant practice;
it's worth it, as it sets you up for success in your chosen career path in the
field of Programming.
